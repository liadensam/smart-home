# Javascript/React - introduction

React is, for years, one of the most widely used Javascript frameworks out there, along with Vue.js and Angular. Granted, the landscape of popular frameworks changes by the week, so it is likely that React (and all the others) will be replaced with newer, shinier options in the future. But that does not mean we shouldn't spend time learning these tools.

First, because they will indeed improve our productivity. Second, because they will increase your chances of getting work you want.
