# Javascript/React - introduction

React is, for years, one of the most widely used Javascript frameworks out there, along with Vue.js and Angular. Granted, the landscape of popular frameworks changes by the week, so it is likely that React (and all the others) will be replaced with newer, shinier options in the future. But that does not mean we shouldn't spend time learning these tools.

First, because they will indeed improve our productivity. Second, because they will increase your chances of getting work you want. And third because learning a new framework is not only about learning tha framework itself, but also about the process of learning a new Javascript tool and related concepts, which is the single most important ability you will develop in this course.

In this Guide you will explore the fundamental aspects of React.Javascript/React

## Name Day and Current Time

I have been playing with the nanem day API as in Czech we celebrate name days, so at the top it shows who has a name day today and then you can input a name and see if it is in the API (Czech names only) or jut does not exist there. You can try for example: Jana, Honza, Anna, Lucie. It is displayed just together as four digit number, but the first numbers two are day, the second two are month. Then just a city selector and then you can see a current time in a specific location and I display first a different location.
